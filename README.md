# Aristotle 
Aristotle is a 2D precision platformer developed with C# and Unity. Aristotle incorporates four abilities that the player must take advantage of in order to complete the levels in Aristotle. The premise of this game entails the son of a scientist (named Aristotle) who got frozen (alongside his father) due to a prank gone wrong. Many years later, the ice that Aristotle is encased in melts. With his father's jacket and the ice ability in tow, Aristotle must overcome many dangerous obstacles and collect other abilities in order to save his father from his frozen prison.

The four abilities are as follows:
* Ice - This ability grants Aristotle invulnerability and high fall impact at the cost of slower movement and not being able to jump.
* Fire - This ability allows Aristotle to dash in one of eight directions. Can only be used once until Aristotle touches the ground.
* Wind - This ability enhances Aristotle's jumping capabilities and allows him to glide mid-air.
* Earth - This ability allows Aristotle to climb walls that have vines attached to them.

Four levels have been designed for Aristotle that incorporates challenges requiring use of each ability on its own alongside incorporating challenges that require the player to use available abilities in combination.
