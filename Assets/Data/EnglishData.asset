  - Key: tutorial.fire_tutorial_1
    Value: Subjects who have the essence of fire have developed the ability to jump
      very quickly in any direction. They seem, however, to be unable to change directions
      once they start.
  - Key: tutorial.fire_tutorial_2
    Value: Subject 45 managed to jump nearly to the ceiling of the test room today.
      He did it by jumping up and activating the fire essence just before he started
      to fall. He has great timing.
  - Key: tutorial.multiple_abilities
    Value: The first group of subjects to acquire multiple essences faired well. While
      I would not recommend putting your body under that much strain, the subjects
      able to complete the obstacle course in record time.
  - Key: tutorial.earth_tutorial_1
    Value: The earth essence tests have shown that subjects gained increased ability
      to climb plant-based surfaces. Particular aptitude was shown when climbing trees
      and vines.
  - Key: tutorial.earth_tutorial_2
    Value: The climbing abilities of the subjects do not go beyond surfaces with plant
      material. The metal walls of the lab, for example, were not climbable for any
      of the subjects.
  - Key: tutorial.earth_tutorial_3
    Value: Tests today consisted of precision climbing. Subjects were asked to climb
      to certain parts of a vine before jumping off onto a platform. Subjects were
      able to stay in place on the wall which helped them succeed.

  - Key: tutorial.ice_tutorial_1
    Value: Tests with the ice essence are progressing well. The ice's natural shield
      protects the subjects from any threat except electrical shocks. Further research
      on the topic is required.
  - Key: tutorial.ice_tutorial_2
    Value: Subjects who use the ice essence were found to be much heavier than their
      standard weight. One subject broke through the floor when she jumped. The metal
      floors are strong enough to resist their weight but the tile floors are not.
  - Key: tutorial.wind_tutorial_1
    Value: The wind essence allows the subjects to jump higher and fall slower than
      they  would normally. Subjects have been able to slow their decent by attempting
      to jump as they fall.
  - Key: tutorial.wind_tutorial_2
    Value: The wind essence has the opposite effect on the subject's weight than the  ice
      ability. Subjects cannot walk against strong breezes, as if they are being blown
      away! Care should be taken when testing outdoors.

  - Key: lore.level1_0
    Value: Aristotle, the scientist's idiot son, got them both frozen in some ice.
      He seems  to have spilt something. I have people blowtorching them now. Hopefully
      they get out before 5, I don't really want to stay late.
  - Key: lore.level1_1
    Value: I brought in some fire essence subjects to try melt them. So far it has
      been unsuccessful.  I realize that the ice shield is immune to everything except
      electricity but I think that might kill them rather than free them.
  - Key: lore.level1_2
    Value: Apparently what was spilt on the scientist and Aristotle was a concentration
      1000x stronger than the test levels that we used on the latest subjects. I am
      unsure what the consequences of that much exposure could be. They may not survive.
  - Key: lore.level1_3
    Value: It has been 10 days now that and the ice has not melted a bit. I think
      that we need to start thinking of new ideas or we may just have to admit they
      are dead.
  - Key: lore.level2_1
    Value: I heard management say that the lab might be closing now that the scientist
      has been frozen for a week. I think they should give him some more time to melt.
      I really don't want to look for a new job. Maybe Aperture is hiring?
  - Key: lore.level2_2
    Value: There are rumours circulating that the head of this facility is frozen
      due to the ice essence. This is untrue. The safety of our essences is our top
      priority. If you have any concerns, please contact the communications department.
  - Key: lore.level2_3
    Value: I think that we have to do something. We can't let word get out that the
      head of the lab and his son are frozen in the basement! Maybe we can fake that
      they went missing on vacation?
  - Key: lore.level3_1
    Value: The head of a prestigious research lab and his son, Aristotle, went missing
      on a hiking trip last month. They are now presumed to be dead. Their death is
      not considered to be suspicious. Anyone with any information is asked to contact
      police.
  - Key: lore.level3_2
    Value: Well, I guess this is our last day as coworkers. I am going to miss you!
      Did you find another job yet? I accepted a position at Black Mesa. It seems
      like a great company. Maybe I can get you a job there too!
  - Key: lore.level3_3
    Value: The lab will be closing on July 31st. Thank you for your time and devotion
      to our research.  If any side affects of your exposure to the essences occurs,
      please present yourself at the nearest emergency room.
  - Key: lore.level4_1
    Value: I was in the basement today. It is so eerie being in the same room as them.
      Aristotle has the  lab coat on him. It makes him look like a ghost. I could
      have sworn that there were new cracks in his ice block, but everyone else disagreed.
  - Key: lore.level4_2
    Value: The only way to break out the pair is by combining all of the essences.
      As we know, that is extremely dangerous. I wonder if we could create something
      to hold the powers instead of a person. A coat perhaps? It doesn't matter now.
      It is done. We have to leave.
  - Key: lore.level4_3
    Value: I have done the final checks. All drones and safety systems are now operational.
      No one  is getting in or out of the lab alive. The secret is safe.
